# Tyler Pho's Password Generator

  This is an application that generates a random password with requirements for the user.  The user must select a designated length
  between 8 - 128 characters as well as options such as Uppercase, Lowercase, Symbols, and Numbers.  Once all prompts are answered
  the password will be generated with the options selected by the user.  The user may generate another password with the same given prompts
  by clicking "Generate a Password" again.  Once the password is generated the user may copy the password to their clipboard by clicking
  the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
